# Lua-logger

## About

Lua-logger is a fork of [LuaLogging](http://neopallium.github.com/lualogging/) which is a port of Log4j upon which it's design was based. The name of the module was changed by [@mwchase](https://github.com/mwchase) in his fork to [`log4l`](https://github.com/mwchase/log4l) to indicate the differences and to assimilate other ports' names of [Lua4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j#Ports) for other languages.
I took [@mwchase's version](https://github.com/mwchase/log4l) and made so many changes I decided to publish it under my own domain and calling my luarock `logger`.

This is free software and uses the same license as Lua.

## Installation

With LuaRocks:

```
luarocks install logger
```
